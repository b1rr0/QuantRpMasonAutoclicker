This app helps players progress through the game of finding stones.
Open the game at 800 x 600  (in this respect the stones are larger).

Then launch the application and it will search for pictures of stones on the screen and automatically click on them.

The application also checks that you are not currently in the open world by the presence of these fields ^^
=====================================================================================================================

Run ApplicationMain.

How it works:
Every 0.5 seconds a screen is taken and all the points on the screens that were not there in the previous screen are found.
And an array is built with identical objects in 2 screenshots.
Where:
=
1 - same.
=
0 - different.

Now it has come down to a problem about islands and finding the maximum island.
Next, hover the mouse and click on the maximum island.
